/*
In JavaScript, operator precedence determines the order in which operations are 
performed in an expression. When an expression contains multiple operators,
JavaScript will first evaluate the operators with the highest precedence, then 
the operators with the next highest precedence, and so on, until the entire 
expression has been evaluated.

   1.  () parentheses
   2.  ** exponentiation
   3.  ! not (logical and bitwise)
   4.  *, /, % multiply, divide, remainder
   5.  +, - addition, subtraction
   6.  <, <=, >, >=, in, instanceof relational operators
   7.  ==, !=, ===, !== equality operators
   8.  & bitwise AND
   9.  ^ bitwise XOR
   10. | bitwise OR
   11. && logical AND
   12. || logical OR
   13. ?: ternary operator
   14. =, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=, **=, ... assignment operators
