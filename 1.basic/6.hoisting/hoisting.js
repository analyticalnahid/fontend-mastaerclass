/* Hoisting is JavaScript's default behavior of moving all declarations to the top 
 of the current scope (to the top of the current script or the current function).

Variables defined with let and const are hoisted to the top of the block, but not 
initialized.Meaning: The block of code is aware of the variable, but it cannot be 
used until it has been declared.
